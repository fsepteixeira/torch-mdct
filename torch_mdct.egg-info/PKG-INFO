# torch-mdct
Pytorch implementation of the 1D Modified Discrete Cosine Transform (MDCT) and its inverse (iMDCT).

The MDCT and its inverse are implemented using 1D regular and transpose convolutions, using a filterbank of Kaiser-Bessel Derived windows with alpha = 4.
The current implementation only allows even filter_lengths and always uses 50% overlap to guarantee perfect reconstruction. 

To install the package, clone the repository and run:

  <code>python setup.py install</code>

This module is an adaptation/combination of the following github repositories:

- https://github.com/nils-werner/mdct
- https://github.com/pseeth/torch-stft

It follows the MDCT implementation described by Bosi, Marina and Goldberg, Richard E. in:
